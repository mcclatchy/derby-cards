# Honeycomb

#### What is it?
This is a base design for McClatchy's Special Projects Template. It has been created for local development that can easily be moved over to Content Studio for testing and publishing. 

#### Why use it?
Honeycomb standardizes and streamlines the process of creating special project designs within Content Studio by providing HTML, styles and scripts to give news developers a running start at customization.

#### Who is it for?
Honeycomb is for McClatchy front-end developers who want to give projects a special treatment beyond the standard article page.
